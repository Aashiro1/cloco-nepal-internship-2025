-DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHAR AND VARCHAR

CHAR
1.	CHAR datatype is used to store character strings of fixed length
2.	In CHAR, If the length of the string is less than set or fixed-length then it is padded with extra memory space.
3.	CHAR stands for “Character”
4.  We should use the CHAR datatype when we expect the data values in a column are of the same length.

VARCHAR
1.  VARCHAR datatype is used to store character strings of variable length
2.  In VARCHAR, If the length of the string is less than the set or fixed-length then it will store as it is without padded with extra memory spaces.
3.  VARCHAR stands for “Variable Character”
4.  We should use the VARCHAR datatype when we expect the data values in a column are of variable length.

-DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DATE AND TIMESTAMP

DATE
1. Stores:	        Only the date (YYYY-MM-DD)	
2. Time Component:	Always set to 00:00:00
3. Size:	        4 bytes
4. Precision:	    No fractional seconds	
5. Use Case:	    Birthdates, holidays, event dates

TIMESTAMP
1. Stores:          Date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS)
2. Time Component:  Includes hours, minutes, and seconds
3. Size:            8 bytes
4. Precision:       Can store fractional seconds (TIMESTAMP(n))
5. Use Case:        Timestamps for logs, transactions, or event tracking
